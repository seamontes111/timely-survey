My team is adding a popup widget to the company's web application to collect a user's
favourite browser through a survey-like submission interface. The company will use this survey
to inform our browser support strategy.

Features:
- An internal visualisation that overview of the results so far, with raw vote counts, and
percentage of the total vote, broken down by browser type per row
- A form submission with the same email address will overwrite the original
submission.
- The customer is notified that they’ve updated their submission
- The form can collect the user's name
- The form can collect their email address
- The form allows a user to select one of the following browser options:
o Edge
o Firefox
o Chrome
o Opera
o Brave
o Vivaldi
- A customer can see the results showing the preferred browsers
o It will display a tabular overview of the results so far, with raw vote counts,
and percentage of the total vote, broken down by browser type per row
- A customer cannot see any personally identifiable information from the form

This is on Port 3000, can be run here: https://upgraded-space-guide-r4qgxq4w47pqh5xjx-3000.app.github.dev/
